          <h3>About Me</h3>
          <p>Hi! Nice to meet you! My name is Freddie Smith Hughes and I'm a Software Developer and graduate of Makers Academy from London. I originally graduated with an undergraduate degree in History from the University of Kent, but decided to make a pretty radical change in career direction and did a software development bootcamp.</p>
          <p>I've been very into programming and development since I was a teenager, starting with making a few games in Flash back when I was 13 and moving on to learning Python as I got older. My interest in software development now is a continuation of that childhood passion. I hope you like some of what I've made.</p>

          <h3>My Projects</h3>
          <Project name="Project Greenprint" description="GreenPrint is an app built as my team's final project for Makers Academy, intended to help you calculate and monitor the amount of carbon your travel produces on a per journey basis. If you enter two locations in the form below the app will generate several routes by mode of travel (driving, public transport, walking, and cycling). You can also calculate the carbon footprint for air travel." siteLink="https://project-greenprint.herokuapp.com/" gitHubLink="https://github.com/SevenSecrets/Project_Greenprint_Backend"/>
          <Project name="Weather Reminders" description="This Ruby app texts me to tell me what the weather is like, including temperature, rain, and UV index. The app currently runs on Heroku and is pinged by a Telegram bot every time someone messages it, responding with the sorted data gathered from the Climacell API about the weather conditions at a location. If the user sends a location in the Telegram message then the weather returned is for that location, otherwise it defaults to Kentish Town." gitHubLink="https://github.com/SevenSecrets/weather-texts"/>
          <Project name="Portfolio" description="This site right here! It's a static React site built using create-react-app, although I also have an alternative version which uses a MERN stack, just to show off a bit. This version is lighter, less intensive, and more mobile-friendly though, so I tend to use it instead." gitHubLink=""/>
